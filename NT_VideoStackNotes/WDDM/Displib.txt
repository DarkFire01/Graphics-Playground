When creating a WDDM miniport driver you have to statically link
to this library displib

I've begun reverse enginering this library an decided to write my own!

I can't be sure the behavior is 1:1 with windows however its as compatible
as i can make it via reversing with windbg, public docmentation. and compiling my own miniport
and stepping through execution!
